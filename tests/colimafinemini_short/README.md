Short test (300 steps) of Coloumb model for colimafine DEM (region of of interest was cropped from oririnal DEM and called colimafinemini)

The vizout and outline reference was generated by original Titan2d-3.0 with hash constant prefactor modified from 8.0 to 1.0 (branch Ref_titan-3.0.0 commit 02f9297752f2e6090d9b1dafa146f9b53b44eb57) as it was changed in Titan2d-4.

The restart reference was generated using commit ff1d3e9a0e18321eaa56af17e4bc5fcab947dfe9 where the run (debug, icc) produce binary identical results for vizout and outline reference.
